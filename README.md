# Emotions Project

Welcome to my first web development project! This project was created using only pure HTML and CSS as an introduction to front-end development.

## About

**Emotions** is a simple yet creative project that explores the representation of different feelings through design elements. The primary goal was to practice foundational concepts of structure, styling, and basic animation using HTML and CSS.

## What You'll Find

- Clean and straightforward HTML structure.
- Styling and simple animations crafted with CSS.
- A layout designed to convey a variety of emotions through colors, shapes, and interactive elements.

## Purpose

This project marks the beginning of my journey in web development. It stands as a milestone of my early learning and is meant to inspire others who are also just starting out in this field.
